The primary objective of this project is to develop a DNA sequencing-based method for the rapid and accurate detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains in diverse environmental samples. This objective will be achieved through the following specific goals:

Method Development: Design and optimize a robust and efficient protocol for extracting DNA from various sample types, including food, water, and clinical specimens, ensuring high-quality DNA suitable for sequencing.

Sequencing Technology Selection: Evaluate different DNA sequencing technologies (such as Illumina, Nanopore, or PacBio) and select the most suitable platform based on factors like read length, accuracy, throughput, and cost-effectiveness.

Primer Design: Develop specific primers or probes targeting conserved and variable regions of the E. coli genome to ensure accurate identification and differentiation of different E. coli strains.

Bioinformatics Pipeline: Create a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for processing raw sequencing data, including sequence alignment, variant calling, and phylogenetic analysis, to determine the genetic identity and relatedness of detected E. coli strains.

Reference Database: Curate and maintain an up-to-date reference database of known E. coli genomes, including pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains, to enable accurate comparison and classification of sequenced samples.

Validation and Sensitivity Testing: Validate the developed method's sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using well-characterized E. coli strains with known genetic profiles. Perform sensitivity testing across a range of concentrations and mixtures to assess the method's detection limits.

Application to Real Samples: Apply the validated sequencing method to real-world environmental samples, including those obtained from food processing facilities, water sources, and clinical settings, to demonstrate its practical utility for E. coli detection.

Comparative Analysis: Compare the performance of the developed DNA sequencing-based method with traditional culturing techniques and other existing molecular methods for E. coli detection in terms of speed, accuracy, and feasibility.

User-Friendly Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for data input, analysis, and result visualization, making the method accessible to researchers, clinicians, and public health officials.

Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Document all methodologies, protocols, and software tools developed during the project and share them with the scientific community through publications, presentations, and open-access repositories.

By accomplishing these objectives, the project aims to significantly advance the field of E. coli detection by providing an innovative, reliable, and rapid DNA sequencing-based method that enhances our ability to identify and manage E. coli infections, thereby contributing to improved public health and food safety.
